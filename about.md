曹睿凡，2006年出生於台中市，2013年遷居雲林古坑。在山腰上的自然環境生活，土地在意識之外指引著她，感官因長時間與自然交流而愈發敏銳；使她想抓住每一道勾起的光與色彩。

世界的珍貴在於「空間」。「空間」是保留真實、包容完整，與生命最貼近的存在。而與每個空間對話，讓她「感覺活著」。

在《到達的地方》；藝術創作與自我的對話中，看見作品自身的生命，如同並行於自己的生命前進。


Cao Rui-Fan was born in Taichung in 2006 and moved to Yunlin County in 2013. She dwells halfway up the mountain, where the earth has always guided her beyond conscious thought. Over time, her senses grew increasingly refined as she attuned herself to the rhythms of nature. It awakened in her a desire to catch every fleeting glimmer of light and every subtle hue in the air.

The world is precious because of space, a space that preserves a sense of truth and holds wholeness. It is a form of existence most intimately connected to life. In attuning to each space, she felt truly alive. 

Within “The Direction to Lean in” exhibition, a dialogue unfolds between the artworks and the creator. She perceives the life of the works as walking alongside her own.
